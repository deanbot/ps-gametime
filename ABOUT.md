# Game Time

Game Time is a gamified habit-tracking/rewards system that helps you progress on goals and play games.

The system is meant to encourage game-lovers to complete meaningful work towards a chosen area in their life, aka reaching a goal or completing a passion project. In Game Time, progress on goals has the added benefit of rewarding you gaming time.

Side effects include: increased connection to goals, increased productivity and an enhanced gaming experience:

- Gaming feels more meaningful with set play-time limits.
- Gamers experience less guilt for 'gaming' vs 'working on goals'.

Game Time in a nutshell:

1. **[Create Jobs](#Create-Jobs)** - Create Quest, Daily, and Rare jobs.
2. **[Do Work](#Do-Work)** - Log job completions and get Game Time points.
3. **[Game](#Game)** - Spend your points to get gaming time. 1 point equals 20 minutes of gaming.

## Create Jobs

Creating jobs in Game Time is easy but requires some forethought and experimentation.

To get started:

- **Learn the job types.** Familiarize yourself with the different types of jobs you can create.
- **Determine your focus goal** Figure out an overarching goal to help you focus your efforts.
- **Brainstorm jobs and their rewards.** Brainstorm jobs that help you achieve your goals. Choose the right rewards for the job.

Also, remember that experimentation is key. It's hard to know which jobs/rewards work best for you without experimenting. You can adapt as you go.

### Job Types

- **Quests**
  - Quests are concrete, repeatable, tasks that push you forward towards reaching your goals.
  - Quests can be logged by completion or by time spent.
    - A **standard** quest will reward the points specified by the job's rewards when completed.
    - A **timed** quest will reward the points specified by the job's rate (i.e. .5 points per hour) and the amount of time spent (i.e. 1.5 hours). In other words, the longer you do the job the more points you get.
- **Daily Jobs**
  - Daily jobs are positive habits, self care, or maintenance tasks which help you be the person who will reach your goals.
  - A daily job will reward the points specifiedfor the job when completed.
- **Rare Jobs**
  - Rare jobs are difficult tasks or milestones that deserve celebration.
  - A rare job will reward the points specified for the job completed, and then the job will be removed.

### Choose a Focus Goal

Spend some time and determine your overarching goals, preferably a single focus goal. A clearly defined goal will help inform the jobs you create in Game Time: each job in game time should help you reach your goal. Avoid spreading yourself too thin by attempting to reach too many goals at once.

### Brainstorming Jobs

Jot down tasks/jobs that will help you reach your focus goal. These could be completion oriented: "complete chapter in course book", time-based: "study French", or specific "finish unit 4". Avoid adding things you will do anyway, or which don't relate to your goal, i.e. doing chores.

Think of the how much you might reward for each. An easy task or one you will do frequently might earn a fraction of a point (i.e. .25). ask may earn 1 or more points

Whether these jobs are quests, dailies, or rare depends. You have options.

### Quest vs Daily vs Rare

In general, if you might complete a job more than once per day, or for a variable amount of time, make it a Quest. Alternatively, if a job is best thought of as a _positive habit_, make the job a Daily. If the job is a milestone, or a one-off really difficult or really important task, make it a Rare job.

Some inidcators the job is a quest:

- this job is a step towards compeleting your goal
- this job can be repeated or done for a variable amount of time

Some indicators the job is a daily:

- the real benefit of this job comes from building it into a daily practice
- you receive deminisihing returns from completing this job more than once in a given day
- completing this job helps you be the person who will achieve your goal

Some indicators the job is rare:

- completing this task deserves proper celebration
- this job can only be completed once

That said, there's no one-size fits all. If you're goal is to become a monk, "meditate" might be better as a quest than as a daily.

## Do Work

As you complete jobs, log them in Game Time and watch your points accumulate.

### Quests

Standard Quests reward the rewards assigned to the job, i.e. .75 points per completion. Timed Quests reward points based on the job's rate and the duration of time spent on the quest. Example: your "Study Latin" goal is worth .75 points per hour, and you worked for 2 hours. Thus you gain 1.5 points.

### Dailies

Daily jobs can be compeleted once per day and reward the rewards assigned to the job, i.e. .25 points. Each daily can be completed once per that calendar date.

### Rare jobs

Rare jobs can be completed once and reward the rewards assigned to the job, i.e. 2 points. Once completed, the job is removed from your list of available jobs.

## Game

Spend Game Time points in order to play video games, computer games, etc... for a set period of time.

**A Game Time point equates to 20 minutes of real life gaming time.**

_Of course, the assumption here is that you won't play games otherwise._

When spending Game Time points, only whole points can be used. I.e., if you have 3.5 points, only 3 points are available for use. Choose the amount you wish to and game for the equivalent amount of time. I.e. spend 3 point to game for an hour. Used points are removed from your balance.

## Adapt as you go

Your jobs in Game Time are not set it stone. Create, edit, and remove jobs as you go. Rare jobs, by nature will be added as time goes on.

If you feel that you're accumulating Game Time points too quickly try reducing rewards. You may want to reduce rewards across the board or only for specific jobs. Consider removing jobs that require little effort.

If you achieve your focus goal, congratulations! Also, it might be time to restart Game Time.
